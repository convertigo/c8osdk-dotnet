## Introduction
This is the Convertigo provider for .NET

Convertigo Client SDK is a set of libraries used by mobile or Windows desktop applications to access Convertigo Server services. An application using the SDK can easily access Convertigo services such as Sequences and Transactions.

The Client SDK will abstract the programmer from handling the communication protocols, local cache, FullSync off line data managment, UI thread management and remote logging. So the developer can focus on building the application.

Client SDK is available for:
* [Android Native](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-android) apps as a standard Gradle dependency
* [iOS native](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-ios) apps as a standard Cocoapod
* [React Native](https://github.com/convertigo/react-native-c8osdk) as a NPM package
* [Google Angular framework](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-angular) as typescript an NPM package
* [Vue.js](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-vuejs), [ReactJS](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-vuejs), [AngularJS](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-vuejs) Framework as a standard Javascript NPM package
* [Windows desktop](https://github.com/convertigo/c8ossdk-dotnet) or [Xamarin apps](https://github.com/convertigo/c8ossdk-dotnet) as Nugets or Xamarin Components
