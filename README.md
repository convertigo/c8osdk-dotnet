### About SDKs ###

This is the Convertigo library for .NET

Convertigo Client SDK is a set of libraries used by mobile or Windows desktop applications to access Convertigo Server services. An application using the SDK can easily access Convertigo services such as Sequences and Transactions.

The Client SDK will abstract the programmer from handling the communication protocols, local cache, FullSync off line data management, UI thread management and remote logging. So the developer can focus on building the application.

Client SDK is available for:
* [Android Native](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-android) apps as a standard Gradle dependency
* [iOS native](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-ios) apps as a standard Cocoapod
* [React Native](https://github.com/convertigo/react-native-c8osdk) as a NPM package
* [Google Angular framework](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-angular) as typescript an NPM package
* [Vue.js](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-js), [ReactJS](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-js), [AngularJS](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-js) Framework, or any [Javascript](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-js) project as a standard Javascript NPM package
* [Windows desktop](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-dotnet) or [Xamarin apps](https://github.com/convertigo/c8osdk-dotnet) as Nugets or Xamarin Components


This current package is the Native .NET SDK. For others SDKs see official [Convertigo Documentation.](https://www.convertigo.com/document/all/cmp-7/7-5-1/reference-manual/convertigo-mbaas-server/convertigo-client-sdk/programming-guide/)

### About Convertigo Platform ###

Convertigo Mobility Platform supports native .NET developers. Services brought by the platform are available for .NET clients applications thanks to the Convertigo MBaaS SDK. SDK provides an .NET framework you can use to access Convertigo Server’s services such as:

- Connectors to back-end data (SQL, NoSQL, REST/SOAP, SAP, - WEB HTML, AS/400, Mainframes)
- Server Side Business Logic (Protocol transform, Business logic augmentation, ...)
- Automatic offline replicated databases with FullSync technology
- Security and access control (Identity managers, LDAP , SAML, oAuth)
- Server side Cache
- Push notifications (APND, GCM)
- Auditing Analytics and logs (SQL, and Google Analytics)

### Initializing and creating a C8o instance for an Endpoint ###

For the .NET SDK, there is a common static initialization to be done before using the SDK feature. It prepares some platform specific features. After that, you will be able to create and use the C8o instance to interact with the Convertigo server and the Client SDK features. A C8o instance is linked to a server through is endpoint and cannot be changed after.

You can have as many C8o instances (except Angular), pointing to a same or different endpoint. Each instance handles its own session and settings. We strongly recommend using a single C8o instance per application because server licensing can based on the number of sessions used.

```csharp
// The .NET initialization for platform specific initialization, should be called once
C8oPlatform.Init();
…
var c8o = new C8o("https://demo.convertigo.net/cems/projects/sampleMobileCtfGallery");
// the C8o instance is ready to interact over https with the demo.convertigo.net server, using sampleMobileUsDirectoryDemo as default project.
```
